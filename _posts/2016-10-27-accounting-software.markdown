<u>Sage 50</u> : <a href="http://www.sage.com/ca/fr"> http://www.sage.com</a>

Formerly Simply Accounting, the accounting software is probably one of the most used in Qu√©bec by French SMEs. It is a comprehensive system that is simple enough to use, but requires training if you want to do everything yourself. You can prepare payroll in Canada by purchasing an additional module.

<u>QuickBooks</u> :   <a href="http://www.quickbooks.com">www.quickbooks.com</a>

This software is very similar to Sage 50. It is a bit of use Sage 50 complex but offers some additional features. An online version in English or French is available (see below).

<strong>cloud-based online software</strong>

These software solutions are available online only: all done in the cloud! Thus, we can do our accounting anywhere, anytime! Very convenient for busy entrepreneurs when on the road. This is clearly the trend in the accounting software field.

<u>Xero: </u> <a href="https://www.xero.com/">https://www.xero.com/</a>

Xero is a complete system with which you can do almost anything. Like most software, you will definitely need an accounting background to use it effectively. If you have an online business, buying some additional modules (plug-in) can help to link your sales and invoices directly. Several additional modules are available, for example to prepare payroll or to communicate with other applications.

<u>Kashoo:   </u><a href="http://kashoo.com/">http://kashoo.com/</a>

This software offers just under additional modules that Xero, but it's definitely a good choice when you need fewer options, and has the advantage of being easy to use. Only one package is available (you can get a discount if your accountant uses it for their clients). In addition to all the basic functions, it can connect to Freshbooks or other software to import data. Note a few weaknesses in creating invoices for customers. We believe the visual interface and usability could be updated.

<u>Sage One</u> :  <a href="http://www.sage.com">http://www.sage.com</a>

This software is very young and was developed by the same company as Sage 50. It works great for invoicing, bank reconciliation and automatically import transactions from the bank account. Work remains to be done by cons to make it a perfect software such as Sage One still does not prepare payroll, and many reports are improving.

<u>QuickBooks Online: </u> <a href="http://www.quickbooks.com">www.quickbooks.com</a>

This version of online QuickBooks desktop software described above is available in an inexpensive basic package. By cons, you will probably soon need more advanced and more expensive packages. We noted that it is sometimes a bit slow when using. For the rest, it is very similar to its desktop version; Note that you cannot perform migration from one platform to another.

<u>Freshbooks: </u> <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">http://www.freshbooks.com</a>

Freshbooks is a system specialized in online sales invoices. This is a good choice for self-employed, since it allows proper monitoring of customer accounts and suppliers. Only drawback: it is not a double-entry accounting system (debit-credit), which may not be sufficient for an incorporated business that requires the production of financial statements.

Feel free to take advantage of free trials that offer most of the software to ensure that its use may become instinctive for you.
